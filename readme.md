# Overview

This program was written as basically a personal crash course for the c# language. I have made tic tac toe programs before but I have never before used c#. So I approached this program which I was familiar with in an entirely unknown language and added a special twist which is that the computer will be playing against the player instead of another player.

This program contains a basic tic tac toe program created in c# utilizing the console as the display and interaction method. It gives the user the ability to play tic tac toe against a computer opponent following all the rules of the game allowing the user to make moves and compete against a computer player.
